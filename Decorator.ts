    * It is a way to add responsibilities to an object without extending its class.
    * It is a way to add functionality to an object without changing its interface.
    * It is a way to add functionality to an object without modifying it.

/*
Drawbacks to this pattern:

    1. It is hard to remove a specific wrapper from the wrappers stack. (Difficulty)
    2. It is hard to implement a decorator in such a way that its behavior doesnâ€™t depend on the order in the decorators stack. (ORDER DEPENDENCY) (UNEXPECTED BEHAVIOR)
    3. The initial configuration code of layers might look pretty ugly. (READABILITY)
